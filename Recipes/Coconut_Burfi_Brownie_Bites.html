    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Coconut burfi is an Indian mithai (sweet) made from shredded coconut and sweetened
    condensed milk with a touch of cardamom. The combo of chocolate and coconut is so magical, 
    and the ground cardamom just makes it even more special.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1/2 c. unsalted butter, melted, plus more for pan </li>
        <li> 3/4 c. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 1/3 c. unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li> 1/2 tsp. baking powder</li>
        <li> 1/2 tsp. kosher salt, divided </li>
        <li> 1/2 c. granulated sugar</li>
        <li> 1/2 c. packed brown sugar</li>
        <li> 3 large eggs </li>
        <li> 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract </li>
        <li> 3 c. unsweetened finely shredded coconut </li>  
        <li> 1/2 c. sweetened condensed milk </li>
        <li> 1 tsp. ground cardamom </li> 
        <li> 4 oz. dark chocolate, melted  </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Directions </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Pre-heat oven to 350Â°. Grease an 8"-x-8" square pan with butter and line with parchment
            paper. Set aside.</li>

        <li> In a medium bowl, sift together all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking 
        powder, and a 1/4 teaspoon salt. In a large bowl, whisk together melted 
        butter, sugar, and brown sugar, until well incorporated. Add 3 eggs one at
        a time, mixing well in between each addition. Whisk in vanilla. Add the dry 
        ingredients and whisk until well combined.</li>

        <li> Pour the batter onto the parchment-lined greased baking pan. Gently spread 
        the brownie batter out into an even layer. Bake for 20 to 22 minutes. Cool 
        completely. </li>

        <li>While the brownies are cooling, combine shredded coconut, sweetened condensed 
        milk, remaining salt, and ground cardamom in a mixing bowl. Gently spread the 
        mixture on top of the brownies into an even layer. You can either use a greased 
        spatula or damp hands to do this. Drizzle with melted chocolate and refrigerate for
         15 minutes before cutting into bite-size pieces to enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
