    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>This robust curry is a staple in many Indian restaurants. With a manageable ingredient 
    list, ours is easy to re-create at home. It's the perfect vegetarian meal for a weeknight 
    (you could even try and make it vegan using extra-firm tofu and canned coconut milk).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Tbsp. canola or vegetable oil </li>
        <li>8 oz. paneer or extra-firm tofu, cut into 1" cubes </li>
        <li>1 small red onion, roughly chopped </li>
        <li>6 slices fresh ginger </li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves </li>
        <li>1 green serrano chile, seeds and white “vein” removed if you prefer less heat </li>
        <li>1 c. canned tomato sauce </li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. ground coriander </li>
        <li>1 tsp. ground cumin </li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. cayenne (¼ tsp. for less heat) </li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. ground turmeric </li>
        <li>1 tsp. kosher salt </li>
        <li>1 lb. baby spinach, finely chopped </li>
        <li>1/2 c. water </li>
        <li>1/2 c. heavy cream </li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. garam masala </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Directions </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet, heat 2 tablespoons 
        oil over medium heat until it shimmers. Add the paneer in one layer and cook until 
        brown on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until brown on the other side, another
        2 minutes. (The paneer will splatter, so be careful!)  Transfer the paneer to a bowl 
        filled with hot tap water to help keep it soft.</li>

        <li>Pulse the onion, ginger, garlic, and chile in a food
        processor until minced. (You may need to add a bit of water to the processor.) </li>

        <li>In a large Dutch oven or saucepan, heat the remaining oil over medium heat until it shimmers. Add the onion paste and cook until 
        light brown and some of it sticks to the bottom of the pan, about 2 minutes. </li>

        <li>Stir in the tomato sauce, coriander, cumin, cayenne, turmeric,
        and salt. Lower the heat and simmer, partially covered, for about 8 minutes.</li>

        <li>Add spinach and cook, covered, until wilted,about 4 minutes. Stir in the water and simmer, covered, until spinach turns a
        pale green color, about 15 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Drain the paneer and add it to the spinach, 
        along with the cream and garam masala. Continue to simmer the curry, covered, 
        stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Serve warm alongside cooked rice or naan.</li>
    </ul>
