    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>Vegetable biryani usually contains yogurt-coated, spiced vegetables that are then
    layered between rice and steamed all together. A saffron liquid is poured over, then
    the dish is topped with caramelized red onions. Spices such as cinnamon sticks, bay
    leaves, and cloves will complement the dish too, which we’ve included in the recipe—but
    you can also choose your own adventure and use up what you have on hand.</p>
