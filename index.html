    <p>Indian cuisine is incredibly diverse. You all find rich curries and breads throughout
    the Northern region, rice- and lentil-based dishes in the Southern—and plenty of sweets, street 
    foods and drinks sprinkled throughout. From everyday dishes meant for weeknight cooking to 
    ones reserved for special occasions like Diwali, you all easily find many that you return to 
    on a regular basis. And, if you’re anything like us, you’ll be inspired to keep a few essentials 
    (like fresh paneer, a jar of ghee and the spice blend, garam masala) on hand, too. </p>
